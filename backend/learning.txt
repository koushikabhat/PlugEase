module.exports = connectDb; is a commonJs and export default = connectDb; is es6 module system

when i just export function name but while require it already checks the imports

while connecting the db or interacting with db always use async and try catch



//when you exports it requires function, object, array etc not a file name 

so module.export = router is done


here i am getting something problem then when i give wrong otp instead of showing 
invalid otp it was showing something went wrong 

because  i have used axios and which caths the erro >400 so i have used status(4oo) so
it was directly targeting catch block 
so what i need to do is 
 case 1 change status code to 200 and sucess false 
 case 2 go to catch block err 
         open err.response.data.message it shows the invalid message
